// You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second occurrence of the second string in the first one.
// 
// Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims". Itâ€™s easy to find its first occurrence with a functionindexOfwhich will point out that "s" is the first symbol in a word "sims" and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0. But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and that means that the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.
// 
// Input:Two strings.
// 
// Output:Int or undefined
// 
// 
// END_DESC

function secondIndex(text, symbol) {
    var p1 = text.indexOf(symbol, text.indexOf(symbol) + 1);
    return (p1 < 0) ? undefined : p1;
