// “Great!” Exclaimed Sofia. “Now we have the password.”
// 
// “To what exactly?” Quipped Nikola.
// 
// “Untold treasures, vast riches beyond belief! Gold! Silver! Silicon! Hydraulic Fluid! Anything your heart        desires!”
// 
// “And you’re going to do what with a password to absolutely nothing?” Nikola smirked.
// 
// “Oh... Right...”
// 
// Stephen spoke up. “Well, this door back here has a keypad. Only thing is the brackets look pretty busted up. We        could try fixing it and then punching in the password?”
// 
// “YES! That!” Sofia exclaimed.

// You are given an expression with numbers, brackets and operators.    For this task only the brackets matter. Brackets come in three flavors: "{}" "()" or "[]".    Brackets are used to determine scope or to restrict some expression.     If a bracket is open, then it must be closed with a closing bracket of the same type.     The scope of a bracket must not intersected by another bracket.     In this task you should make a decision, whether to correct an expression or not based on the brackets.     Do not worry about operators and operands.
// 
// Input:An expression with different of types brackets as a string (unicode).
// 
// Output:A verdict on the correctness of the expression in boolean (True or False).
// 
// Precondition:
// There are only brackets ("{}" "()" or "[]"), digits or operators ("+" "-" "*" "/").
// 0 < len(expression) < 103
// 
// 
// END_DESC
