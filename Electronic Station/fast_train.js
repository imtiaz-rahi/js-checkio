// You are planning the train schedule and you want to know the minimum time between the stations.
// 
// Each section of the rail between stations is given in the Array.Each section is a tuple of distance and speed limit (both are integers).You can change the speed ( +1. -1 and ± 0 ) at the start and every minute after that.The train runs by the same amount as the speed value in a minute.
// Note: This means that a train with a speed of 2 will travel a distanse of 2 before another minute passes and its speed can be changed again.
// 
// Starting speed is 0.Speed limit is set for each section of the rail.        You don't exceed it.You must reach the target station at speed 1 (because it’s necessary to stop at the station).You should return the minimum time (minutes) as an integer.
// 
// 
// 
// Input:Array of the section of the rail. Each section is an array of distance (as an integer) and speed limit (as an integer).
// 
// Output:The minimum time (minutes) as an integer.
// 
// How it is used:
// For efficient acceleration and deceleration.
// 
// Precondition:
// distance > 0speed limit > 0len(section) > 0
//
