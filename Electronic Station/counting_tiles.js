// Stephan needs some help building a circular landing zone using the ice square tiles for their new Ice Base.    Before he converts the area to a construction place, Stephan needs to figure out how many square tiles he will need.
// 
// Each square tile has size of 1x1 meters.     You need to calculate how many whole and partial tiles are needed for a circle with a radius of N meters.     The center of the circle will be at the intersection of four tiles. For example: a circle with a radius of 2 metres    requires 4 whole tiles and 12 partial tiles.
// 
// Input:The radius of a circle as a float
// 
// Output:The quantities whole and partial tiles as a list with two integers -- [solid, partial].
// 
// Precondition:
// 0 < radius â‰¤ 4
// 
// 
// 
// END_DESC
